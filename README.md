To compile
```bash
make
```
Then run:
```bash
./bin/main [argument]
```
Where the argument is:
- `init` - this initializes the `results.csv` file
- the name of a sorting function - this appends the stats for the sort to `results.csv`

To see the name of the sorting functions, run:
```bash
./bin/main
```
To run the tests on all sorting functions:
```bash
./bin/main all
```
